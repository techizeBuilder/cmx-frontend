# Debug Checklist: SuperAdmin Issues

## Quick Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Check if Login Works
- Go to: `http://localhost:5174/cmx-super/login`
- Use: `superadmin` / `admin123`
- **Expected**: Redirect to dashboard

### 2. Check if Dashboard Loads
- Should see: Shop list with sample data
- Should see: "Add Shop" button in top right
- **If not loading**: Check console for JavaScript errors

### 3. Check if Modal Opens
- Click "Add Shop" button
- **Expected**: Modal popup appears with Step 1 form
- **If not working**: Check console for errors

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot read properties of undefined"
**Solution**: Component reference issue
```javascript
// Dashboard tries to access modal before it's ready
// Fixed with null check in openAddShopModal()
```

### Issue: Modal doesn't appear
**Causes**: 
- CSS Bootstrap not loaded
- Modal backdrop conflicts
- Component not properly mounted

### Issue: Shop list is empty
**Solution**: 
- API server not running (expected - uses mock data)
- Should show 3 sample shops automatically

### Issue: Form validation not working
**Check**: 
- All required fields marked with *
- Password confirmation matching
- File upload size validation

## Quick Fixes Applied

1. ✅ **Modal Component**: Rebuilt with Bootstrap (no Vuetify dependency)
2. ✅ **Reference Fix**: Added null check in dashboard
3. ✅ **Form Validation**: Enhanced with better error messages
4. ✅ **File Upload**: Added size validation and preview
5. ✅ **Mock Data**: Fallback data when API unavailable

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Check if dev server is running
curl http://localhost:5174

# Check for JavaScript errors in terminal
# Look for compilation errors in the npm run dev output
```

## If Still Having Issues

Please let me know:
1. **What specific error message** you see (console or screen)
2. **Which step fails**: Login, Dashboard load, or Modal open
3. **Browser console errors**: Press F12 → Console tab
4. **Network errors**: Press F12 → Network tab

## Expected Behavior
✅ Login → ✅ Dashboard with shops → ✅ Click "Add Shop" → ✅ Modal opens → ✅ 3-step form works
